This repository contains the backend API for my ToDo App, which is being developed using React. The web application is currently still in development.

Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/todo-app-api.git
Import the SQL database file todo_db_dump.sql into a new MySQL database. This file contains the required table structures and sample data for the ToDo App.

Usage
Open the project in your preferred development environment, such as Visual Studio Code.

Ensure that all necessary dependencies are installed. You can do this by running the command npm install in the terminal.

Start the API by running the command npm start in the terminal.

The API will be running by default at http://localhost:3000. You can use this URL to access the endpoints.
